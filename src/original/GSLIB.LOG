
     GSLIB 90 Log file to record changes to all GSLIB programs.

                  Last Modified: March 2, 2000


This file is maintained as a log of changes, bug fixes, and new features
to the GSLIB programs.  The FORTRAN 77 code in the second edition of
GSLIB, published by Oxford University Press, is the official version of
GSLIB.  Since the start of 1998, changes have been made to the official
version.  The source code of these changes havehas not been released
to the public, although PC executables have been.  The source code is
reserved for sponsors of the Centre for Computational Geostatistics
(CCG).  The source code will be released with the third edition planned
(tentatively) for 2003.

To summarize the transition from FORTRAN 77 (F77) to FORTRAN 90 (F90):

o. Initial conversion to F90 undertaken in summer of 1998 when
   dynamic memory allocation and command line specification of
   the parameter file was coded.  The version number was set
   to 2.900.  All bug fixes and maintenace considered the F90
   versions from that time forward.  The F77 versions were not
   kept up to date.
   
   The only change to the parameter files was in sgsim/sisim where
   the size of the covariance lookup table appears after the
   search specification.  A "template" parameter file can always
   be generated by executing the program and entering return (in
   a directory where there is no parameter file).
   
o. Bug fixes through summer of 1999 when provision was made for
   long file names (512 characters) and file names with blanks.
   This is more compliant with Windows file naming conventions.
   The version number was set to 2.901 in the fall.
   
o. Bug fixes and enhancements continued through March 2000 with
   the version number being incremented in selected programs.
   Some programs reached a version number of 2.904.
   
In March 2000, the programs were revisited to correct minor bugs
(ik3d for example) and to add error checking (in the variable number
of the variogram programs for example).  The version number was reset to
2.905 and the source code was then released at the March 2000 CCG
meeting and put on the www.gslib.com website.

All changes from 2.905 will be entered below in this log file.   
   
LOG OF CHANGES:   
   
o. March 16, 2000.  locmap (version changed to 2.906).  Feature added
   to permit symbols with no lines around them.  The label option 
   should be set to -1 for this.  Of course, that means that one
   cannot plot a label AND no line at the same time.  When there is
   a reason to skip the line, there are too many symbols for lables.

o. March 16, 2000.  backtr (version changed to 2.906).  Bug determining
   size of transformation table fixed.

o. April 25, 2000.  Multiple grid search changes to sgsim/sisim/sisim_gs
   and sisim_lm (versions changed to 2.906).  Changed to -imult instead
   of +imult due to search according to descending order.

o. April 25, 2000.  Changed kt3d to use local mean in kriging estimate,
   that is, option 2 was not fully functional before.  Incremented 
   version number to 2.906.

o. May 1, 2000.  Changed kb2d to correct Lagrange parameter in
   calculation of kriging variance and to correct the use of range
   parameter in exponential and Gaussian variogram models.  Version
   number changed to 2.906

o. May 9, 2000. Modified programs that output a grid to write nx/ny/nz 
   after "nvar" specification on the second line of the output file
   Version number changed to 2.907

o. May 10, 2000. Modified ik3d to handle kriging with one grid node
